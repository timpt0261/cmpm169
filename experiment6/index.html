				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>
					I originally wanted to imitate a snake-like pattern that utilizes text to create a visibly interesting pattern.
					As well as taking inspiration from the Matrix to create a new visually appealing effect.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>
					With Grammars and Text Art being the grand focus I wanted to create the pattern through text. 
					I integrated a class-labeled character grid to manage where to place text characters on the 
					screen and manage variations with use to avoid the error of updating all characters on the screen simultaneously. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>
					To innovate I wanted to integrate the random Walk algorithm from the former program to create a more generative piece 
					of art where the letters would shift around the canvas randomly. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					Reflecting on my progress, I am very glad to have been able to create something unique. 
					While not my original intention I am glad how it turned out where the result is that of a 
					dark tower in the distance floating above the water.
				</p>
