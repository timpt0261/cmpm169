			<h1>Experiment 4 - Images, Video, & Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>
					I originally wanted to imitate the visual appeal of a CRT TV  or a GameBoy Color Display. 
					I originally wanted to create something with a retro aesthetic.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>
					Keeping in mind of video specifically, I want to use P5.js's createVideo to be in real time. 
					So I specifically tried to find a way to modify or change the video asestic. Especially how to 
					render the pixels with varying shapes from squares, to circles, to points, to current lines.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>
					To innovate, I like to make all my pieces interactive so I add functionality so that the lines
					move around based on the mouse position. As well users can modify the number of lines and modify 
					their width.  As well as to change the shapes that are drawn throughout or to randomize it.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					I am comfortable with what I have accomplished because I am visually 
					pleased with what I have created. Aging, though it was not what I originally
					intended to make I am satisfied with the overall project.
				</p>
