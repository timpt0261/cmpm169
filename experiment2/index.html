				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>
					To begin, I am first inspired to create something that first contrasts color and secondly something that repeats itself. 
					Specifically I was first trying to create a design where it was to be a room with an interactive room pattern. While also
					taking inspiration from the Generative Design Book on P_1_0_01 and P_1_2_3_01 for their use of geometric shapes and color.
					So initially I started with creating a random color and inverse color function.
				</p>

				<pre>
					function randomColor() {
						return color(random(256), random(256), random(256));
					}
					
					function inverseColor(I_COLOR) {
						var r = red(I_COLOR);
						var g = green(I_COLOR);
						var b = blue(I_COLOR);
						return color(255 - r, 255 - g, 255 - b);
					}
				</pre>
			</div>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>
					To integrate varying techniques I started to use the experiment with shapes. 
					Where the I wanted to experiment with creating a shape that adds more edges the closer you get to the center.
					Then to integrate variety and interaction it started with first making the color of the shape to always differ 
					to something new when loading the page. Afterwards I integrate techniques such as color lerping to create a more 
					gradual contrast with colors of the shape where it's the most contrasting to least contrasting color within the shape. 
					I also integrate buttons so users can interact with rotation, color, and the number of shapes that can drawn within.

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p> 
					To innovate I decided to remove the background and to add more shapes all round to create a more trippy like effect, especially when rotating.
					At first with removing the background I noticed that it leaves previous drawings of previous shapes behind.
					Where the background hides the redundant shapes. However I created an interesting effect when drawing a circle and wanted to replicate multiple instances of that.
					I wanted to create more shapes like the design above, but creating more instances would lead to the webpage crashing. 
					So I decided to create a matrix of the same ship close together.Realizing the matrix of the same ship when rotating around gives off a very
					psychedelic ominous feeling.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					Reflecting on what I have learned, and accomplished, is that I am proud of having created what I have created. 
					As it was, the creation was simple and has a clean look to it. It was far from my original design. 
					However despite this I am very proud of how it looks and may continue to modify it as so.
