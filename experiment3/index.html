			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>
					I wanted to create an art piece that originally took inspiration from the Salvadoran Folk Artist Fernando Llort. 
					Originally the idea was to create a generative piece of art that uses his use of geometric shapes and an intense 
					color palette to create something alike.

						<img id="sal_art_01" src="../img/experiment_3/image2.png" width='195' height='93'> 
						<img id="sal_art_02" src="../img/experiment_3/image4.png" width='140' height='90'> 
					</div>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>
					Keeping in mind the idea of generative art I wanted to integrate a procedural generation a background made of varying 
					organic-looking shapes overlapping one another. However, I decided instead to create a simple implementation of a
					 Random Walk Algorithm that would create points all around the canvas.
				</p>

					<div class="image-container">
						<img id="shape-change" src="../img/experiment_3/image5.gif" width='150' height='150'> 
					</div>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>
					To innovate I used code from my previous project to instead create circle rings, that would randomly be a color pallet from Fernando Llort`s work.
					As well as using noise and mapping depending on the mouse position it will create more sharper to smooth circles.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					Having worked on it by myself, I think I have worked on it for a good amount of time as though I didn't come to my original vision, 
					I am still proud of it. As it still incorporates a lot of style.
